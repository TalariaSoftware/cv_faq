The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.</p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html\">many types</a>&nbsp;of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.

          "answer": "<p>People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.</p>\n<p>Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.</p>\n<p>Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem.</p>"

Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people.

Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.</p>\n<p>How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.</p>\n<p>Current <a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-hospitalized-patients.html\">CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation</a>&nbsp;is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.</li>\n<li>The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.</li>\n<li>The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.</p>"

          "question": "Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?",
          "answer": "<p>Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.</p>"

Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p>\n<p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>\n<p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.</p>\n<p>Learn what is known about the <a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html\">spread of COVID-19</a>.</p>"

Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.

The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.&nbsp;This type of spread is not a concern after death.</p>\n<p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>\n<p>People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and facemask).</p>\n<p>Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-03/documents/sars-cov-2-list_03-03-2020.pdf\" target=\"new\" class=\"tp-link-policy\" data-domain-ext=\"gov\">Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims<span class=\"sr-only\">pdf icon</span><span class=\"fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span><span class=\"file-details\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">external icon</span><span class=\"fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a> are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.

Call your local veterinary clinic&nbsp;<u>before</u>&nbsp;bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.</p>\n<p>This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.</p>"

          "question": "While school’s out, can my child hang out with their friends?",
          "answer": "<ul>\n<li>The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to limit contact as much as possible. If you have play dates, keep the groups small. Encourage older children to hang out in a small group and to meet outside rather than inside. It’s easier to keep and maintain space between others in outdoor settings, like parks.</li>\n<li>If you have small meetups, consider hanging out with another family or friend who is also taking extra measures to put distance between themselves and others (social distancing). Make sure children practice <a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html\">everyday preventive behaviors</a>, such as washing their hands often with soap and water. Remember, if children meet outside of school in bigger groups, it can put everyone at risk.\n<ul>\n<li>Revise spring break plans if they included non-essential travel.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Information about <a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/children-faq.html\">COVID-19 in children</a>&nbsp;is somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with COVID-19 may only have mild symptoms. However, they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including <a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/people-at-higher-risk.html\">older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions</a>.</li>\n</ul>"

          "answer": "<ul>\n<li>Stay in touch with your child’s school.\n<ul>\n<li>Many schools are offering lessons online (virtual learning). Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers.</li>\n<li>Communicate challenges to your school. If you face technology or connectivity issues, or if your child is having a hard time completing assignments, let the school know.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible.\n<ul>\n<li>Have consistent bedtimes, and get up at the same time, Monday through Friday.</li>\n<li>Structure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity.</li>\n<li>Allow flexibility in the schedule—it’s okay to adapt based on your day.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group.\n<ul>\n<li>The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school.</li>\n<li>Consider ways your child can stay connected with their friends without spending time in person.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Look for ways to make learning fun.\n<ul>\n<li>Have hands-on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things.</li>\n<li>Independent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encourage children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks.</li>\n<li>Practice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face-to-face contact.</li>\n<li>Start a journal with your child to document this time and discuss the shared experience.</li>\n<li>Use audiobooks or see if your local library is hosting virtual or live-streamed reading events.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"
